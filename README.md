# Shorts Multiuploader

A reusable, code-first pipeline for cross-posting your own YouTube Shorts to
Instagram, Threads, TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Naver Clip.

Playwright handles the normal upload path with your locally authenticated Chrome
profile. Codex Browser/Computer is a recovery layer for individual failed cells,
inconclusive verification, and platform UI changes. No creator handles, campaign
names, cookies, or account URLs are built into this repository.

> Use this only for content you own or are authorized to distribute. You are
> responsible for each platform's terms, rate limits, advertising disclosures,
> and local law. UI automation is inherently brittle, so inspect every dry run
> before enabling unattended use.

## Why this skeleton exists

Cross-posting is not one six-step script. It is a matrix of independent
`video x platform` jobs whose upload, verification, and retry states must survive
partial failure. This repository already provides the less glamorous pieces:

- YouTube discovery and download through `yt-dlp`
- H.264 normalization with `ffmpeg`
- chronological posting, oldest first
- SQLite deduplication and post-verification state
- isolated platform lanes so one broken login does not stop the others
- exact-text checks before publish
- screenshots, HTML, and a cell-specific recovery brief on failure
- declarative per-video policies for campaign text, target platforms, and
  disclosure controls
- an agent skill that knows when to use code and when to take over the UI

## Architecture

```text
YouTube channel
    |
    v
plan -> prepare -> content policy -> H.264 -> platform lanes
                                              | upload
                                              | verify
                                              v
                                  SQLite state + run report
                                              |
                                      failed cell only
                                              v
                                  Browser/Computer fallback
```

The unit of work is one matrix cell, not the entire batch. A login failure on
Facebook can block the Facebook lane while Instagram and TikTok continue. A cell
is never retried merely because an upload dialog disappeared; fresh platform
verification must first show that the post is missing.

See [architecture.md](.agents/skills/shorts-upload/references/architecture.md)
for status semantics, ownership boundaries, and extension constraints.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Google Chrome
- `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and `yt-dlp`
- macOS is the primary tested environment; the Python and Playwright layers are
  portable, but profile and Chrome behavior should be verified on your OS
- Codex Desktop with Browser/Computer tools only if you want agent recovery

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/shorts-multiuploader.git
cd shorts-multiuploader
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your own channel, targets, handles, and verification URLs. Then:

```bash
# Create or refresh local login sessions. Repeat for enabled platforms.
uv run shorts-dist login instagram
uv run shorts-dist login tiktok

# Read-only checks, followed by a no-publish dry run.
uv run shorts-dist doctor
uv run shorts-dist run --dry-run

# Run the configured batch.
uv run shorts-dist run
```

Login profiles live under `data/profiles/` and never belong in Git. Close Chrome
windows using the same profile before starting a pipeline command.

## Configuration

The main batch controls are:

```dotenv
YOUTUBE_HANDLE=@your-youtube-handle
TARGET_PLATFORMS=instagram,threads,tiktok,linkedin,facebook,naver
POST_TEXT_MODE=caption
SHORTS_SELECTION_MODE=recent
SHORTS_UPLOAD_LIMIT=2
SHORTS_LOOKBACK_LIMIT=50
SHORTS_SKIP_ADS=true
PROFILE_STRATEGY=shared
```

Use `shared` for the simplest setup or `per-platform` to isolate Chrome profiles.
The remaining account and verification settings are documented in
[.env.example](.env.example).

### Creator-owned content policies

Campaign and channel-specific logic belongs outside the source code:

```bash
cp config/content-policies.example.json config/content-policies.json
```

Set `CONTENT_POLICIES_FILE=config/content-policies.json` in `.env`. A matching
rule can:

- use the full YouTube description instead of the default caption
- prepend or append required disclosure text
- restrict the Short to an approved subset of platforms
- request a supported UI disclosure such as Instagram `paid-partnership` or
  TikTok `branded-content`

Explicit `--video-id` selection does not bypass these policies. Unsupported or
missing disclosure controls fail closed before publishing.

## Commands

```bash
# Inspect and prepare
uv run shorts-dist platforms
uv run shorts-dist list-shorts --limit 10
uv run shorts-dist plan --json
uv run shorts-dist prepare --video-id <YOUTUBE_ID> --json

# Upload and verify
uv run shorts-dist run --json
uv run shorts-dist run --platforms instagram,tiktok --video-id <YOUTUBE_ID>
uv run shorts-dist upload <platform> <YOUTUBE_ID>
uv run shorts-dist verify --pending

# State and manual/agent completion
uv run shorts-dist status
uv run shorts-dist mark-uploaded <platform> <YOUTUBE_ID> \
  --url '<POST_URL>' --source agent
```

`run` and `upload` return exit code `3` when one or more cells need attention.
The run report under `data/runs/<run_id>/report.json` contains the complete
matrix, evidence, artifacts, and recovery briefs. Exit code `3` is a partial
attention signal, not permission to abandon healthy lanes.

## Built-in platforms

| Platform | Upload | Verification | Policy disclosure |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Instagram Reels | Playwright | Reels caption/metadata | `paid-partnership` |
| Threads | Playwright | profile/search evidence | - |
| TikTok | Playwright | Studio content list | `branded-content` |
| LinkedIn | Playwright | recent activity | - |
| Facebook | Playwright | configured videos URL | - |
| Naver Clip | Playwright | Creator Studio list | - |

Platform UIs change without notice. Selector candidates are intentionally kept
as ordered lists, and failures capture both a screenshot and full HTML for
repair. See [customization.md](.agents/skills/shorts-upload/references/customization.md)
before adding a platform or policy action.

## Safety rules

1. Never duplicate-upload without fresh platform verification.
2. Publish only the prepared `post_text` or its documented platform truncation.
3. Keep the selected video IDs fixed while recovering a partial batch.
4. Finish healthy matrix cells before waiting on one blocked platform.
5. Treat login, 2FA, CAPTCHA, copyright, account-context, and paid-promotion
   prompts as human decisions.
6. When asked to stop, terminate the pipeline and its child browser processes,
   then confirm they are gone.
7. Never commit `.env`, `data/`, browser profiles, screenshots, HTML captures,
   downloaded media, cookies, or SQLite state.

## Agent skill

The reusable skill lives at
[`.agents/skills/shorts-upload/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/shorts-upload/SKILL.md).
It keeps Browser/Computer usage focused on failed cells and documents the
self-healing selector workflow.

## Development

```bash
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
uv run python -m compileall -q src
```
